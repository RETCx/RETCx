Professional Googler | Sleepless Coder | Music Junkie | Fake Psychologist (INTP 6w5)

Ask me anything—except why my code isn’t working.

I speak fluent Python, C, C++, NumPy, Pandas, and ML, but Spotify speaks for me better! 🎶
I’m the type to train a machine learning model and then wonder why it’s giving me attitude (spoiler: I probably forgot to clean the data). Coding for me is 90% Googling, 10% praying that it compiles without errors.

Music is the rhythm to my chaos. Whether it's Lauv, The 1975, Taylor Swift, or even One Direction (no judgment), my playlist is as random as my sleep schedule. If deep discussions about algorithms and AI aren’t your thing, we can always bond over Spotify song recs. 🎧

Tech gadgets? I’m all in. I’m that person who will spend hours reading about the latest device, even if I know I probably don’t need it. From smartwatches to AI-powered toasters, if it's tech-related, I’m intrigued. But beware: I’ll probably end up convincing myself I need it for a new “project” (even if the project is just to keep track of how bad my sleep cycle is). 📱💻

And yes, when I’m not coding, I’m either lifting weights at the gym or planning my next workout routine. Balancing ML and gym time is kind of my thing. Trying to debug code while sore from leg day is just part of the grind, right? Whether it’s deadlifts or debugging, I’m all about optimizing performance—though my squats are way better than my coding some days. 💪🏋️

As an INTP (aka "The Thinker") in the MBTI world, I’m all about analyzing everything—whether it’s machine learning problems or the plot of my current manga obsession. I get lost in thought a lot, sometimes to the point where I forget basic things, like what day it is (thanks, insomnia). But hey, overanalyzing is just my thing! If you’ve ever wasted hours on which dataset to choose, we’re probably on the same wavelength. 🌌

In the Enneagram world, I’m a 6w5, which means I’m the “Loyal Guardian.” I love making sure things are in order and double-checking (okay, triple-checking) my code before running it. The Wing 5 side of me is all about learning—I’m always diving into new subjects, whether it’s tech, psychology, or finding new ways to hack my sleep cycle. Basically, I’m a cautious explorer with a love for knowledge and a backup plan for when things don’t go right (especially when my ML model decides to throw a tantrum).

Math at 3 a.m.? Sure, I probably can’t prove any theorem, and I still won’t know what day it is when I’m done (please, just let me sleep 😴). Sleep schedules? Those are for people who don’t spend their nights wondering why TensorFlow decided to crash yet again. 🌚

And don’t get me started on the coder-insomnia memes. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
If words fail you, send me a song, and let’s vibe. 🎶

My Thai is okay, but my English is a whole new level of ‘lost in translation (Valley)’—100% Thai, 200% confused! 😂 5555

100% randomness guaranteed, but always ready to chat—or hit you with a random math fact or workout tip!
